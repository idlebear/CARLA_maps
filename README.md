![Town03 Pedestrian Locations](examples/Town03_pedestrian_map.png)

A simple python based xml parser to render maps from the Carla simulator as occupancy grids for planning/training. A sample grouping and the resulting render for Town03 can be found in the [local docs folder](docs/).

### Usage:

Note that this is not yet set up as a package, and the requirements.txt is still missing.  Further updates are pending.  If you like it, or would like to make a change, pull-requests are welcome.
